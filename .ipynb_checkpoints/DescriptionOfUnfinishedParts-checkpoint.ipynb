      "I did not get a chance to plot all four of the situations where the approaching galaxy is in the rest frame.  I had an idea of how to accomplish this though!  I believe that if I can set the origin at the center of the \"S\" galaxy, the plot should work how I want it to.  This would require that the origin move with each time step.  I can accomplish this by writing a loop that can iterate through the trajectory of the \"S\" galaxy, and can subtract or add certain x and y values to the S and M galaxies at each time step to make the x and y coordinates for S = (0, 0).  If I do this, the M galaxy would shift from the origin by those x and y values as well, and it should mimic an approaching M galaxy situation. "

      "I also did not get a chance to animate my graphs.  I know that there is an internal matplotlib animation module that can animate, but I really did not have time to make it work and adapt it to my data.  Additionally, I could have used a program called ffmpeg.  In that case I would have looped through my time steps, and had saved my plot images to a folder.  The ffmpeg program would have put all of the images together into an animation."
